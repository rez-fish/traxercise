This is a website that I made using react on the front end and Firebase on the backened as a database. The app is simple and allows you to save what you did as an exercise that day and be able to view it at a future date.

You use a calendar to choose a day you would like to view. This would be used to see if someone is making progress in there workouts.

I didnt take a lot of time to style the web page because my main focus was learning and applying my react skills.
